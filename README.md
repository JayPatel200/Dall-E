# Dall-E Clone

An AI platform that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language using OpenAI API.
Users can share and download the images as well.

(If getting an error when trying to generate new images, I ran out of the OpenAI API credits)

MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Tailwind CSS, Cloudinary, OpenAI API

May take a while to load at first since the backend is hosted on render and the server goes to sleep if it doesn't get any requests for 15 mins.
